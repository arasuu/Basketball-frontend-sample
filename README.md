🏀 Basketball Scoreboard

This is one of my first projects while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It’s a simple basketball scoreboard where you can add points for the Home and Away teams.
The team with the higher score is highlighted, and there’s a New Game button to reset everything.

🔧 What I Used

HTML for structure

CSS for styling

JavaScript for interactivity

💡 What I Learned

I learned how to use JavaScript to change the content on a webpage, handle button clicks, and update styles dynamically.
